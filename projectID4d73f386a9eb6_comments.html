<HTML><BODY>Again an intriguing book by a clergyman who turned atheist, using his knowledge of Biblical literature to paint a completely different picture of Solomon.

<p>Expect lots of references to the Bible and other religious books, some odd accents (macrons, etc.), especially when dealing with oriental names, citations in smaller print (please mark in formatting) and some poetry. A few Hebrew words, which can be marked [**Hebrew] or [**Hebrew: ...] if you can transcribe it, as well as Greek.</BODY></HTML>
